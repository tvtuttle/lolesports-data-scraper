# this file is for developing the format for input and output
# in both cases, there will be an excel spreadsheet with information regarding fantasy team and player choices
# after input, the spreadsheet will be filled with stats (from scraper), calculate fantasy points, and return a
# resulting sheet

# before setting up import, i'll need to decide what the spreadsheet will look like
# so, first, work on a demo fantasy spreadsheet on google sheets
# the input should just take the form of fantasy player, chosen team, chosen players
# similar to the status of last season's spreadsheets before stats were added, only without newly ignored stats
# (i.e. no first blood or elder dragon)

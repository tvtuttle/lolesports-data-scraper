The goal of this project is to create an easily-implementable Fantasy LCS game and stat tracking system, in lieu of an official Fantasy LCS league.
Fantasy LCS is a game inspired by such other fantasy sports games as fantasy baseball and fantasy football, in which fantasy players create fantasy teams of real sports players and calculate their statistics from real games to determine which fantasy team has the best roster of real players. Fantasy LCS applies this popular fantasy concept to professional League of Legends, one of the most popular "esports" (competitive video games) in the world.
This program, when given a list of fantasy players and the members of their fantasy team (a real team and 7 real players), scrapes the commonly-used and regularly updated Leaguepedia wiki (lol.gamepedia.com) to determine the statistics of the real team and players, then calculates their resulting fantasy scores and returns the results in a formatted spreadsheet.

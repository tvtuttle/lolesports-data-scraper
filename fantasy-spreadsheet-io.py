# this file is for developing the format for input and output
# in both cases, there will be an excel spreadsheet with information regarding fantasy team and player choices
# after input, the spreadsheet will be filled with stats (from scraper), calculate fantasy points, and return a
# resulting sheet

# before setting up import, i'll need to decide what the spreadsheet will look like
# so, first, work on a demo fantasy spreadsheet on google sheets
